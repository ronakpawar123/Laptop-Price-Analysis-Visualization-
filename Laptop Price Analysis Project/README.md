# 💻 Laptop Price Analysis & Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Laptop Price Analysis & Visualization** project is an end-to-end data analytics solution that analyzes laptop pricing trends based on hardware specifications and brand information.
The project combines **Python for data analysis and machine learning** with **Power BI for interactive visualization**, helping to identify key factors that influence laptop prices.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze laptop pricing data using exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Identify key features affecting laptop prices such as CPU frequency, RAM, and brand
* Build a machine learning model to predict laptop prices
* Create an interactive Power BI dashboard for business insights
* Enable data-driven comparison across different laptop configurations

---

## 🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains detailed laptop specifications, including:

* Company (Brand)
* CPU company and CPU frequency
* RAM size
* GPU company
* Storage type and capacity
* Display features (IPS, Retina)
* Touchscreen support
* Operating System
* Laptop price (in Euros)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive way to analyze laptop pricing trends.

### Dashboard Features:

* **KPI Card** showing average laptop price
* **Bar Chart**: Average laptop price by RAM
* **Scatter Plot**: CPU frequency vs average laptop price by company
* **Slicers** for Company, RAM, Operating System, and Touchscreen

All visuals are built using **average-based measures** to ensure meaningful comparisons.

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* Laptop prices increase with higher CPU frequency
* Higher RAM configurations generally have higher average prices
* Brands follow different pricing strategies
* CPU frequency and brand together strongly influence laptop pricing

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

* A regression-based model was built to predict laptop prices
* Model performance was evaluated using standard regression metrics
* The trained model was saved as a `.pkl` file for future use or deployment

---

## 🌟 Key Highlights

* End-to-end data analytics project
* Correct use of aggregations and DAX measures in Power BI
* Interactive and business-friendly dashboard
* Combination of analytics, machine learning, and visualization
* Internship-ready project structure

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Implement advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost
* Perform feature importance analysis
* Deploy a web-based price prediction app using Streamlit
* Integrate real-time or e-commerce pricing data
* Enhance Power BI dashboard with additional insights

---

## ✅ Conclusion
